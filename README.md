# E-commerce Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

This project presents a SQL-based data analysis of sales and customer behavior in a simulated e-commerce environment. Using a relational dataset composed of multiple tables (orders, products, customers, etc.), I explore key business questions and generate insights that could help stakeholders make strategic decisions.

## Objective

Analyze an e-commerce dataset using SQL to:
- Identify top-performing products and categories
- Understand customer behavior and sales trends
- Evaluate revenue performance over time
- Practice advanced SQL querying techniques (JOINs, GROUP BY, CTEs, etc.)
