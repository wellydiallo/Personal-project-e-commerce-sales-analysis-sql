# E-commerce Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

This project presents a SQL-based data analysis of sales and customer behavior in a simulated e-commerce environment. Using a relational dataset composed of multiple tables (orders, products, customers, etc.), I explore key business questions and generate insights that could help stakeholders make strategic decisions.

## Objective

Analyze an e-commerce dataset using SQL to:
- Identify top-performing products and categories
- Understand customer behavior and sales trends
- Evaluate revenue performance over time
- Practice advanced SQL querying techniques (JOINs, GROUP BY, CTEs, etc.)

## Dataset

The dataset comes from a public Kaggle source:  [Target E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

Tables used in this project:
- `customers`
- `orders`
- `order_items`
- `products`
- `payments`
- `sellers`

## Technologies Used

- SQL & Python
- GitHub for project sharing

## Questions explored

1. What are the top 10 most sold products?
2. What is the monthly sales trend?
3. Which product categories generate the most revenue?
4. What are the most active and profitable customers?
5. What is the average revenue per order?
6. What is the profit margin by product?
7. Which sellers have the highest number of sales?

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- The most sold products mostly belong to the highest revenue categories.
